[[ch-rotation]]
= Rotation of contents


Objects that are output with `<PlaceObject>` can be rotated.
For this purpose, there is the attribute `rotate`, which expects an angle (in degrees), whereas positive values cause a clockwise rotation.

    <PlaceObject rotate="10">
      <Image file="_sampleb.pdf" width="3"/>
    </PlaceObject>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When an object is rotated, you need to specify the point around which it should rotate.
The default setting is the upper left corner.
With the attributes `origin-x` (`left`, `center` and `right`) and `origin-y` (`top`, `center`, `bottom`) you can define the axis of rotation.
In addition to these values, numbers from 0 to 100 are also possible, the upper left corner is 0, 0 and the lower right corner is 100, 100.

.The image is rotated by 10 degrees. A negative value would make the rotation counterclockwise.

TIP: In https://github.com/speedata/examples/[examples repository on github] there is a document in the `technical` directory which shows the effect of `origin-x` and `origin-y`.

== Rotate images

The attribute `rotate` is available for both `<PlaceObject>` and `<Image>`. The attribute at `<Image>` can only rotate images in 90° steps. Therefore, in practice the rotation is rather controlled by `<PlaceObject>`.

== Rotate via transformation

Using the command `<Transformation>` (see section <<ch-outputtingobjects-transformation>> and in the appendix the <<cmd-transformation,command description>>) you can also rotate contents.
The matrix has the form "cos θ sin θ -sin θ cos θ 0 0", for a rotation of 90 degrees thus "0 1 -1 0 0 0".
This is shown in the section <<ch-tables-imagebehindtext>>.
