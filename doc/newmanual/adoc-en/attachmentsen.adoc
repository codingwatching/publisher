= Attach files to the PDF

The PDF file format offers the possibility of embedding files in the document so that they can then be downloaded as stand-alone documents. Electronic invoices, for example, can be sent as a “human-readable” PDF with an attached computer-readable description (as XML).

Any number of files can be attached, but only one ZUGFeRD invoice.

== Attach files

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<AttachFile description="A nice view"
            type="application/pdf"
            filename="ocean.pdf" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This command is used to attach a file to the PDF. The type is the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type[mime type] of the attached file.


.This is what attached files look like in Adobe Acrobat.

== Attach ZUGFeRD invoices

To attach an electronic invoice, the value at type must be exactly the string ZUGFeRD invoice:

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<AttachFile description="Electronic invoice"
            type="ZUGFeRD invoice"
            filename="invoice.pdf" />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


The output filename is automatically set to ZUGFeRD-invoice.xml and the document conforms to the PDF/A-3 standard.

.The file name is changed to ZUGFeRD-invoice.xml.
