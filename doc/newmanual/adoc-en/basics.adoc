The study of this chapter should be sufficient to create layout rules by yourself. Occasionally, more detailed topics will be covered in more detail in a later chapter. For example, only the most important formatting for tables is dealt with; a separate chapter (chapter <<ch-tables2,Tables>>) describes tables in detail. In such cases there is of course a cross-reference.

TIP: Another note for the manual. Many examples only show the layout file and not the corresponding data. In the data file the simple structure `<data />` is always assumed. This can be recognized by the fact that the layout contains `<Record element="data">`. The easiest way to start the Publisher is to use `sp --dummy`, which simulates this data file.
