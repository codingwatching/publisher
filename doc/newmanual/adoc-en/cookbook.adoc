In this section concrete applications are shown, with designed data, but with requirements occurring in practice. Three chapters (Table of Contents, Index, and Page X of Y) are implemented using the same mechanism with the XML element structure (chapter Creating XML Structures).

[[ch-directories-marker]]
== Automatically generated directories

This chapter is dedicated to the creation of directories.
There are basically two ways to create a directory.
Therefore, the next section is about the built-in mechanism of markers (`<Mark>`), the following sections are about the way via `<Element>` and `<Attributes>` and manually saving the data for another pass.

TIP: In order for the Publisher to run through several times, the `runs` parameter must be set on the command line or in the configuration file, for example with `sp --runs=2` (command line) or `runs = 2` (configuration file). In the section <<ch-cookbook-toinonerun>> a mechanism is shown how in some cases a directory can be created in only one run.
