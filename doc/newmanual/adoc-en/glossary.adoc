+
  * The document contains only properly encoded legal Unicode characters.
  * None of the special syntax characters such as < and & appear except when performing their markup-delineation roles.
  * The start-tag, end-tag, and empty-element tag that delimit elements are correctly nested, with none missing and none overlapping.
  * Tag names are case-sensitive; the start-tag and end-tag must match exactly.
  * Tag names cannot contain any of the characters `!"#$%&'()*+,/;<=>?@[\]^{|}~`, nor a space character, and cannot begin with "`-`", "`.`", or a numeric digit.
  * A single root element contains all the other elements.

XPath::
   Computer language that is specialized for data queries in XML trees. Typical questions are "What is the content of the 'name' attribute?" or "Is there a child element named 'chapter'? The language is often used together with XSLT (XSL Transformation). A subset of the XPath language is built into the Publisher.
