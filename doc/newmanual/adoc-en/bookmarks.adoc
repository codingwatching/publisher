PDF Bookmarks can be used as an alternative table of contents for the PDF viewer (e.g. Adobe Reader). Almost all of these programs can display bookmarks. You can use them to jump directly to certain places in the document. A special feature of bookmarks is that they are arranged hierarchically (level). For each bookmark you can use the attribute open to determine whether it should be displayed “open” or “closed”.

Bookmarks are displayed in texts or on the level of `<Record>`.

.Bookmarks are used for quick navigation in a PDF document. On the left is an excerpt from the PDF viewer Skim and on the right Adobe Acrobat Reader.

Important: The levels must be consecutive. A level 1 bookmark may only be followed by another level 1 bookmark (for the next section) or one on level 2 (subsection).
