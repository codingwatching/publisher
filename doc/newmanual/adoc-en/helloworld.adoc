= Hello, world!




The classic: “Hello, world!” Or: what does a simple document look like?
As already described, the input for the Publisher consists of two files: the data file and the layout file.
Both must be in XML format and must always be available.
The data file is saved under the name `data.xml` and the layout file under `layout.xml`.
These two files are best created with an XML editor or with the free text editor https://code.visualstudio.com/[Visual Studio Code] which has very good XML support.

TIP: If you want to try the “Hello World” example yourself, you can simply call `sp new helloworld`. This creates a directory with the two necessary files. So you can start immediately and create a PDF in this directory with the `sp` command.

The data file for the “Hello World” example is named `data.xml`:

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<data>Hello world!</data>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That is enough for the simple example. The layout file is a bit more extensive (save as `layout.xml`):

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Layout
  xmlns="urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en"
  xmlns:sd="urn:speedata:2009/publisher/functions/en">

  <Record element="data">
    <PlaceObject>
      <Textblock>
        <Paragraph>
          <Value select="."/>
        </Paragraph>
      </Textblock>
    </PlaceObject>
  </Record>
</Layout>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These two files are stored in an otherwise empty directory. On the command line, change to this directory (with `cd <directory name>`) and call the Publisher with the command

[source,shell,subs="verbatim,quotes"]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sp
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

on. The `$` character is intended to represent the prompt and is not entered. If everything goes smoothly, the result is a PDF file named `publisher.pdf` in the same directory.

TIP: For Windows users: if the publisher cannot create the PDF, this is sometimes because the same file is still open in a window. This can be Adobe Reader, but also Windows Explorer.

== The “Hello World!” example explained

Here follows a short explanation of the two files. The data file can be structured as you wish, as long as the content is well-formed XML (see <<app-glossary,glossary>>).

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<data>Hello world!</data>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The layout file is a bit more complicated, at least at first sight.

[source, xml]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<Layout  <!--1-->
  xmlns="urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en"
  xmlns:sd="urn:speedata:2009/publisher/functions/en">

  <Record element="data">  <!--2-->
    <PlaceObject>  <!--3-->
      <Textblock>
        <Paragraph>
          <Value select="."/> <!--4-->
        </Paragraph>
      </Textblock>
    </PlaceObject>
  </Record>
</Layout>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<1> The root element is called `Layout` and has the namespace `urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en`. The second namespace is necessary for the built-in functions, but is not used in the example. (Tip: nevertheless always specify it in the layout, so that there are no surprises later).
<2> Here the data processing starts. The root element of the data file is specified in the attribute `element`.
<3> `<PlaceObject>` is the command to output things (texts, images, boxes, ...) into the PDF.
<4> The dot at the select attribute means “the current element”, in this case the root element. The text value of the element is output here, i.e. the string `Hello world!`

We will not discuss more at this point. Rather, there is a reference to the corresponding chapters in this manual: Under <<ch-fileorganization>> is described how the data file and the layout file are to be structured, and under <<ch-outputtingobjects>> the command `<PlaceObject>` is described.
