= Visual Studio Code

The free (and open source) text editor https://code.visualstudio.com[Visual Studio Code] (short: VS Code) can be used for many programming languages thanks to numerous extensions. To use the speedata layout schema, the XML extension from Red Hat is required:

.Open the extensions marketplace and search for `xml`. The extension from Red Hat is the right one.

This extension is controlled via so-called https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_catalog[XML catalogues].
In these catalogs an association of namespace to a schema is created.
Two ready-made catalogs are supplied with the speedata Publisher which link the speedata namespace with the corresponding schema files.
In this way, you only have to include the catalog:

.In the settings the variable `xml.catalogs` can be changed. This must be set to `catalog-schema-en.xml` or `catalog-schema-en.xml`. Of course the path must be adjusted.

There are two different schema files, each documented in two languages. For the English documentation `catalog-schema-en.xml` must be used, for the German documentation `catalog-schema-de.xml`.

If everything worked out fine, a layout with the namespace `urn:speedata.de:2009/publisher/en` will get the auto-complete with description:

.auto-complete with short description in the Visual Studio code.
